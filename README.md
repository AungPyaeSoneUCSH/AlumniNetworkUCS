## 🌍 Complete Server Installation Guide (Ubuntu VM)

The following guide outlines how to deploy the application for production on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine.

### Step 1: Server Preparation

Ensure your Ubuntu Virtual Machine has all the foundational packages required for a modern Node.js application.

1. **Update the system and install core utilities:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl git nano ufw docker.io nginx

```


2. **Install Node.js and NPM:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

```


3. **Install PM2 globally (Daemon process manager):**
```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2

```



### Step 2: Database Setup (MongoDB via Docker)

Virtual Machine hypervisors often do not pass through AVX CPU instructions, causing standard native installations of MongoDB 5.0+ to crash immediately. Deploying MongoDB 4.4 using Docker is the most stable workaround for a VM environment.

1. **Enable and start the Docker service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

```


2. **Deploy the MongoDB Container:**
```bash
sudo docker run --name local-mongo -d -p 27017:27017 --restart always mongo:4.4

```



### Step 3: Application Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/AungPyaeSoneUCS/AlumniNetworkUCS.git
cd AlumniNetworkUCS

```


2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install

```


3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
```bash
nano .env

```


*Ensure your database string points to the local Docker container (e.g., `MONGODB_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/AlumniNetworkDB"`).*

### Step 4: Folder Permissions

For user uploads (like profile pictures) to work correctly, the web server needs explicit read and write access to your public directory.

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 public/

```

*(Note: If you ever delete and recreate the public folder, you must run this command again).*

### Step 5: Process Management (PM2)

To avoid "ghost processes" and `EADDRINUSE` port 3000 conflicts, run the Next.js binary directly.

1. **Build the production application:**
```bash
npm run build

```


2. **Start the application:**
```bash
pm2 start ./node_modules/next/dist/bin/next --name "next-app" -- start

```


3. **Save the active process list:**
```bash
pm2 save
pm2 startup

```



### Step 6: Web Server & Reverse Proxy (NGINX)

Configure NGINX to handle web traffic securely and serve uploaded files directly from the disk.

1. **Create the NGINX Configuration:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/alumna.ucsh.edu.mm

```


2. **Paste the Server Block:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name alumna.ucsh.edu.mm;

    # SSL Configuration 
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ucsh_fullchain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/ucsh.key;

    # Main Proxy to Next.js
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    # Serve user uploads directly from the disk for instant rendering
    location /uploads/ {
        alias /home/hinthadauser/AlumniNetworkUCS/public/uploads/;
        access_log off;
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
    }
}

# HTTP to HTTPS Redirect
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name alumna.ucsh.edu.mm;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

```


3. **Enable and Restart NGINX:**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/alumna.ucsh.edu.mm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx

```

## 🔄 Standard Update Workflow

Whenever new code is merged into the GitHub repository, follow this workflow to update the live server cleanly and prevent cache conflicts.

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd ~/AlumniNetworkUCS

```


2. **Pull the latest code:**
```bash
git pull origin main

```


*(Troubleshooting: If local files are overwritten, force the update with `git fetch --all` and `git reset --hard origin/main`).*
3. **Clean the cache and rebuild:**
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run build

```


4. **Restart the application:**
```bash
pm2 restart next-app

```

## Update Project From Git to Server
### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Folder

Log into your server via PuTTY and move into your application directory:

```bash
cd ~/AlumniNetworkUCS

```

### Step 2: Pull the Latest Code from GitHub

Download the new files you just uploaded to your repository:

```bash
git pull origin main

```

*(If your primary branch is named something else like `master`, use `git pull origin master` instead).*

### Step 3: Update Dependencies (Optional but Recommended)

If you added any new packages or libraries to your `package.json` file, you must install them on the server:

```bash
npm install

```

### Step 4: Clean and Rebuild the Application

To ensure Next.js doesn't use old, cached versions of your pages, it is best practice to delete the old build folder and compile a fresh one:

```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run build

```

### Step 5: Restart the Live Server

Tell PM2 to restart your application so it starts serving the newly built code:

```bash
pm2 restart next-app

```

### Step 6: Verify the Update

Check your process list to ensure the app is running smoothly and hasn't crashed (the `↺` restart counter should remain stable):

```bash
pm2 ls

```

Once `pm2 ls` shows the app is `online`, go to your live website and press **`Ctrl + F5`** to do a hard refresh. Your new code and files will now be live!

Did the build process complete successfully without any errors?
